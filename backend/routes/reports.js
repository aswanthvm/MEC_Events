// DEPRECATED - This file is replaced by reportRoutes.js
// This old route file was causing validation conflicts with legacy fields
// 
// The new reportRoutes.js file handles the proper schema with:
// - eventName, date, location, coordinator, registrations, checkIns, feedbackScore
//
// Legacy fields (eventId, attendees, winners, prizeMoney) are optional in the new schema

// If you need this file, use the reportRoutes.js instead
module.exports = {};
